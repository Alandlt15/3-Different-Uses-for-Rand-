# 3360HW2-Q3
This repo is from HW2 in my Computing System Fundamentals (3360) course with 
Dr. Mina Guirguis. Fall 2024.

Description: Using a pseudo random number generation function (e.g., rand() in C or other equivalent functions in other
languages) that generates uniformly distributed random numbers, write three functions that generate the
following:

Function a: 
100 uniformly distributed integers between 0 and 99.

Function b:
100 uniformly distributed floating numbers between 0.25 and 0.5.

Function c:
100 numbers in which the number 1 is produced with probability 0.5,
the number 2 with probability 0.2, otherwise a floating number 3 and 4.
